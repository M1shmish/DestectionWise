# DestectionWise
**A Collection of Sigma detection rules.**

##Overview

In this project I will try to cover and detect different use cases related to suspicious event that any blue teamed would like to watch for in their Microsoft Windows environment.

My job as a SIEM engineer, IR steamer and threat researcher taught me few things:

* what is a threat and how to detect it
* how to write rules
* what to do when they fire
* most of businesses will do nothing for their security until they are hacked

so I decided to test my knowledge in front of a big crowd (The opemn source community/free stuff community), to showcase any business decision maker that might be reading this how easy it is to penetrate an organization without implemented security measures and how important good detection really is, and mainly improve my skills.

This is an ongoing project, I will try to upload new rules or articles on weekly basis so stay tuned.
