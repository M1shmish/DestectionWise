# DetectionWise

_"Good fences make good neighbors."_

Less of a fence but more of a security cam calibration, here is a collection of Sigma detection rules.

## Overview

In this project, I will try to cover and detect different use cases related to suspicious events that any blue team member would like to watch for in their Microsoft Windows environment.

My job as a SIEM engineer, IR team member, and threat researcher taught me a few things:

- What is a threat and how to detect it
- How to write rules
- What to do when they fire
- Most businesses will do nothing for their security until they are hacked or get rules for free.

So, I decided to test my knowledge in front of a big crowd (the open source community/free stuff community) to showcase to any business decision maker reading this how easy it is to penetrate an organization without implemented security measures and how important good detection really is, and mainly to improve my skills.

## Contributing

This is an ongoing project. I will try to upload new rules or articles on a regular basis.

If you have any inputs to give me, mistakes you've found, suggestions, questions, or anything else, I would like to hear from you about it.

Hope you enjoy the reading and the "Sigma Rules."
